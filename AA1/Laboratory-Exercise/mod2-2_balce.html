    <h1> OMORI </h1>
    <p> In the most spoilerless way I can describe it, OMORI is a game (not an Anime as I don't watch that much Anime, unfortunately ._.) about a little boy known as Omori as he travels through Headspace, a land totally just full of wonders, joy, and maybe some buff guys, I dunno. However, if you know the meaning of the word "headspace", you'll know that these journeys are actually just dreams of a real boy named Sunny. Will Sunny fix his real life problems? Or will he just slop in bed, dreaming about fighting literally the planet Earth and etc.? I will not say anything further.</p>
